# orbit-360-python

This sample project shows how to control an Orbit360 using python. 

## What does it do?

The example script sends a movement command to the Orbit360 using the `bluepy`. 
However, porting to other bluetooth libraries should be straight-forward. 

For the command format, please refer to the inline comments. For further command formats or receiving remote control events from the Orbit360, please refer the Android SDK for now. 

## Work in progress

This repository is work in progress/early access. We will update it accordingly in the near future.
